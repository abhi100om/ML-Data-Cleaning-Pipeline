# ML-Data-Cleaning-Pipeline

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is part of my **AI & ML Internship**. The goal of Task 1 is to learn and apply **data cleaning & preprocessing** techniques on a real dataset. I used the **Titanic dataset** (from Seaborn) since it contains missing values, categorical features, and numerical features â€” making it perfect for this task.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Explore raw dataset and understand its structure  
- Handle missing values (imputation with median/mode, special category for missing)  
- Encode categorical features into numerical format  
- Apply normalization and standardization to numerical features  
- Detect and handle outliers using **boxplots** and **IQR method**  
- Save the cleaned dataset for further ML tasks  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn** (for encoding & scaling)

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository  
- `Task1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` â†’ Google Colab notebook with all code & outputs  
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` â†’ Cleaned dataset with preprocessing applied  
- `titanic_final_for_model.csv` â†’ Final dataset ready for ML model training  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation (this file)

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed  
1. **Data Exploration (EDA)** â†’ checked shape, info, null values, and summary stats  
2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - `age` â†’ filled with median  
   - `embarked` â†’ filled with mode  
   - `deck` â†’ filled with a new category `"Missing"`  
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables** â†’ one-hot encoding using `pd.get_dummies`  
4. **Feature Scaling** â†’ applied both normalization and standardization for numeric columns  
5. **Outlier Detection** â†’ used IQR method & boxplots for `age` and `fare`  
6. **Dataset Export** â†’ saved cleaned datasets as CSV for reuse  
7. **Bonus** â†’ trained a simple Logistic Regression model as a sanity check

## ðŸ“– Key Learnings  
- Different types of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)  
- Encoding strategies: Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding  
- Normalization vs Standardization  
- Outlier detection using IQR and visualization  
- Importance of preprocessing in improving ML model performance  

---

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Visuals  
- Distribution plots (Age, Fare)  
- Count plots (Class vs Survival)  
- Boxplots for Outliers  
- Correlation heatmap  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Cleaned datasets will be saved in `/content/` (if Colab)  
4. You can download them or directly use for ML model training
